# Welcome

Welcome to my portfolio page. This is brand new, so for now this site will look rather... lackluster.

## About Me
I am newbie when it comes to programming, I've been learning for around 3 months now. I'm just glad I'm learning THE actual thing.
At the moment, I am learning C#. All of my programs will be written in that language.
