# Welcome

Welcome to my portfolio page. This is brand new, so for now this site will look rather... lackluster.

## About Me
I am newbie when it comes to programming, I've been learning for around 3 months now. I'm just glad I'm learning THE actual thing.
At the moment, I am learning C#, so all of my programs will be written in that language.
My hobbies are usually reverse-engineering/datamining games, playing them, anime, and other computer-y things that aren't programming or coding xD

## My Projects
These projects are private right now, but they will be public at a later time.

### [Adventure Game](https://github.com/ReviveZygarde/adventure-game)
The objective of the game is somewhat linear, where you are teleported into a cybernetic world and go through many different locations, befriending a cat, and meeting a knight, trying to save a girl from a monster named Skeith.
This is a CLI, text-heavy adventure game with ASCII visuals. This is still a work in progress, and may have bugs.

### [GUI Tip Calculator](https://github.com/ReviveZygarde/tip-calculator-GUI)
My very first GUI Tip calculator that I accidentally made by myself and didn't know this was supposed to be a group project ':D
I had a lot of fun with this, and it felt like it was much less intimidating than making a console application.

### [GUI Group Project 1](https://github.com/ReviveZygarde/group-GUI-project-1)
Basically a super simplified version of cookie clicker made by me, Grace, and Alex. Input anything in the text box, and click on the button as many times until it tells you've clicked an X amount. That X value is random.

### [Trivia Game](https://github.com/ReviveZygarde/trivia-game)
A super short, 2-question trivia quiz game that also happens to be the very first C# program I've ever made.

### [Explorable Areas I](https://github.com/ReviveZygarde/explorable-areas-1)
A group assignment made by Leo Vallecillo, Zack Wheelhouse, and myself. This is another small game that is a CLI.

### [Study Application](https://github.com/ReviveZygarde/study-app)
A CLI study application with programming terms. It's very buggy and ugly...
